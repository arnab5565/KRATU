            <p>
                When I am writing this we have only three members in Kratu, me and my cousins.
                We are school students trying to make something which will help people all over
                the world. Kratu is founded by three of us, the name is given by my eldest cousine.
                Initially it was very difficult for us to do all of this. This took us a whole year to
                complete the project. But we are sure that it will help many. And we are also trying to
                improve and add more things.

            <p>Kratu is an idea, an idea to think and choose different. Idea to choose convinience.
                That is why we created Kratu editor and Kratu docs.
                Kratu editor is for new developers who are not so used to heavy IDEs. It is created
                so that they may learn the basics before shifting to any IDE. Kratu is just like
                notepad but much better. We are also trying to make Kratu editor for mobile, currently
                it is under development. We know the world is constantly evolving and the use of smartphones
                are increasing. But writing program codes in a smartphone can be a tidious job, so we
                are creating Kratu editor for smartphone to tackel this problem. If you want to learn more

                We believe knowledge is free and no one should pay for knowledge. Thats why we created Kratu docs.
                Here you will find qualitiy topics absolutely for free. We want a world where everyone can have
                knowledge without paying single penny for it. This way we can see a world where settlement on
                different planet will no longer be dream. People who really want to learn different things and to
                explore different things will no longer be chained. If you are a hungry learner and want to learn
                something new you may visit Kratu docs and you may find something new to learn about. To visit
